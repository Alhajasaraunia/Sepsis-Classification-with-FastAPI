This project aims to swiftly and accurately classify sepsis cases for healthcare professionals.
The project "Sepsis Classification with FastAPI" has a clear objective: to construct a precise and effective classification system for sepsis cases through the utilization of the FastAPI framework. Sepsis is an extremely serious medical condition necessitating immediate medical attention. This undertaking addresses the critical necessity of promptly identifying and categorizing sepsis cases, a process essential for swift treatment and enhanced patient outcomes.

The project entails the following goals:

1. Machine Learning Model Training, Train a machine learning model using a diverse collection of sepsis cases to accurately predict the probability of sepsis in patients.

1. FastAPI Web Interface, Creating a user-friendly and efficient web interface utilizing the FastAPI framework, enabling healthcare professionals to easily interact with the sepsis classification model.

3. Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy by elevating diagnostic accuracy to achieving high levels of precision, sensitivity, and specificity in sepsis classification.

4. Scalable Solution Provide a comprehensive and scalable solution that can be seamlessly deployed in real-time healthcare settings.

In this project several challenges are encounted. These include sourcing and preprocessing a reliable sepsis dataset, identifying an apt machine learning algorithm, fine-tuning the model's performance, and ensuring secure and efficient deployment of the system.
By tackling these aspects, the project aims to greatly enhance the medical field's capability to quickly and precisely categorize sepsis cases. This, in turn, will lead to better patient care and outcomes.
